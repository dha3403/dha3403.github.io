    		<p>On the Mornington Peninsula (one hour from Melbourne) next door to Portsea.</p>
		<p>Our apartment is a lazy 10-minute walk from the relaxed township of Sorrento that offers restaurants, cafes, a chemist, a supermarket, a butcher and lots more. It is located in a quiet 			avenue, just 4 houses from the beach. It is in easy walking distance of the ocean beaches and surf.</p>
		<p>Your private luxury apartment consists of a spacious living area with leather lounge suite overlooking a sun drenched, tree-filled private garden.
		A separate kitchenette has everything you need to make your stay relaxed and comfortable. A queen sized bedroom and an amazing bathroom complete with free standing black bath 			entices you to relax and unwind.</p>
		<p>Two TVs are sure to make everyone happy!  An undercover BBQ area with seating offers plenty of space to stretch out and enjoy that cup of freshly brewed coffee or a glass of wine.
		This is the perfect place for a home away from home.</p>
